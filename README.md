ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HendrikPetertje or Peter for those that like it short

Originally I'm from the Netherlands where I grew up. 
After attempting life in microbiology, studying Graphic design, Multimedia development and having had my own company for a while, I ended up In "North" Sweden where I work for a nice company called Knightec Group - Softawre & Cloud. 

I spend most of my time working with front-end and back-end development and use tools like Javascript/Typescript, SQL, Elixir, Ruby, some Python, AWS, Azure and the usual GxP/GMP lingo around Med-Tech
I even have a podcast about it where my colleagues and I share what we are working on! check it out over at [knightsonwires.knightec.se](https://knightsonwires.knightec.se/)

When not in the office I'm a total space-geek, spending late afternoons trying to hack together all kinds of contraptions that base off satellite- and ground-station-api data, the latest of which at the time of this writing being a bot that warns me and my colleagues when to run outside to see the beautiful auroras, you can find it over at https://aurora.hendrikpeter.net. 

Space isn't the only thing I geek on, You can find me hidden in different kind of de-centralized web projects like the dat-protocol and SSB, making all kinds of funny contraptions for sustainable communication in the 21st century with apps like Tightbeam. 

Next to all of that I teach Programming and the chops of software development to fantastic students all over the world through organizations like "Global Code".

You can run into me on hiking trails when when I'm not doing any of the above.

I'd love to talk about Vim by the way, you can chat me up at any time of the day. ;)
